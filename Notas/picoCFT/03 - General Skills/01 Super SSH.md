# Descripción

Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.Can you `ssh` as `ctf-player` to `titan.picoctf.net` at port `64541` to get the flag?You'll also need the password `f3b61b38`. If asked, accept the fingerprint with `yes`.If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: [https://webshell.picoctf.org](https://webshell.picoctf.org/)If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: [https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell](https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell)
